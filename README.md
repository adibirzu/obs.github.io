# OCI Observability Atlas

**A guided path from L0 to L4 for designing enterprise observability on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure — with every service framed as a Landing Zone add-on you attach after deployment, per customer need.**

🔗 **Live:** [obs.octodemo.cloud](https://obs.octodemo.cloud) · mirror: [adibirzu.github.io/obs](https://adibirzu.github.io/obs/)

Built on the [Oracle Redwood Design System](https://www.oracle.com/) (Georgia + Figtree, warm-stone palette, Lucide icons). Static, self-contained, no build step.

---

## What this is

A single-page guide that helps **any user** — executive, architect, or practitioner — find the right OCI Observability & Management (O&M) services for their use case and adopt them in the right order:

- **Use-case finder** — pick your estate pattern (traditional app, database-centric, OKE, Oracle apps, hybrid, agentic) and get a recommended path with concrete outcomes.
- **The L0 → L4 ladder** — 31 O&M and AI services, each opening an inspector with Executive / Architect / Practitioner lenses, copy-ready MQL/OCL/OTel snippets, and a "Learn more" panel of curated guides + open-source projects.
- **Collection-agent comparison** — Oracle Cloud Agent vs. Management Agent vs. Unified Monitoring Agent.
- **AI agent observability (L4)** — the SAIF / Zero Trust / Observability triad and a modern Instrument → Collect → Analyse → Evaluate → Act reference diagram.
- **Landing Zone add-ons** — how observability attaches **after** the OCI Operating Entities (OE) Landing Zone is deployed (see the diagram below).
- **Resources** — curated DevRel guides, demos, and the maintainer's public observability projects, mapped per service.
- **[Interactive launchpad](https://obs.octodemo.cloud/launchpad.html)** — the companion operations console.

## The L0 → L4 model

| Level | Theme | Question it answers | Example services |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0** | Govern & land | Is the platform ready to be observed safely? | Observability compartment & IAM, Tags, Vault, Audit |
| **L1** | See & alert | Is it healthy, and what just happened? | Monitoring, Logging, Notifications, Events, Health Checks, Dashboards |
| **L2** | Diagnose deep | Why did it happen, and are we out of room? | Database Management, Ops Insights, Log Analytics, Management Agent, Stack Monitoring, Java Management |
| **L3** | Correlate & automate | What's the business impact, and what can self-heal? | APM + OpenTelemetry, Connector Hub, Resource Scheduler, OS Management Hub, Fleet App Mgmt |
| **L4** | Observe & govern AI | Is the agent correct, grounded, safe, improving? | APM GenAI, Generative AI (judge) + guardrails, Logging Analytics anomaly, Data Science eval, Cloud Guard Instance Security, Gen AI Agents |

## Landing Zone add-ons — attach after deploy

Observability is **not** a separate build. Deploy the [OCI Operating Entities (OE) Landing Zone](https://github.com/adibirzu/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities) first; then enable each add-on independently, on top of the live Landing Zone, choosing only what each use case needs — no teardown.

## Propose a new monitoring scenario

This guide is meant to grow. To add a use case (e.g. "observability for an EBS estate" or "tracing a CrewAI multi-agent app"):

1. Read **[docs/PROPOSE-A-SCENARIO.md](docs/PROPOSE-A-SCENARIO.md)** — the scenario template and what a good one contains.
2. Open a **[Monitoring scenario issue](../../issues/new?template=monitoring-scenario.yml)** (or copy the template into a PR).
3. Or extend the data directly: add an entry to [`assets/resources.js`](assets/resources.js) (links/projects per service) or propose a new finder pattern in [`assets/guide.js`](assets/guide.js).
