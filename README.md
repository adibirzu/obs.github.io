# OCI Observability Atlas

**A persona- and industry-driven path from L0 to L5 for designing enterprise observability on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure — find the right O&M and AI services for who you are and what you run, and enable them when you need them.**

🔗 **Live:** [obs.octodemo.cloud](https://obs.octodemo.cloud) · mirror: [adibirzu.github.io/obs](https://adibirzu.github.io/obs/)

Built with the Oracle Redwood design language (Georgia + Figtree, warm-stone palette, Lucide icons) for familiarity. Static, self-contained, no build step.

## What this is

A single-page guide that helps **any user** find the right OCI Observability & Management (O&M) services for their role, industry, and use case, and adopt them in the right order:

- **Start by persona + industry** — pick who you are and where you work; the page tailors the levels, services, and default lens. Access is governed by OCI IAM (personas → OCI Groups + scoped policies).
- **Use-case finder** — pick your estate pattern (traditional app, database-centric, OKE, Oracle apps, hybrid, agentic) and get a recommended path with concrete outcomes.
- **The L0 → L5 ladder** — 31 O&M and AI services, each opening an inspector with Executive / Architect / Practitioner lenses, a "Relevant to" persona row, copy-ready MQL/OCL/OTel snippets, and curated guides + open-source projects.
- **Collection-agent comparison** — Oracle Cloud Agent vs. Management Agent vs. Unified Monitoring Agent.
- **AI agent observability (L4)** — the SAIF / Zero Trust / Observability triad and a modern Instrument → Collect → Analyse → Evaluate → Act reference diagram.
- **Multitenancy at scale (L5)** — centralized Log Analytics aggregation across tenants and clouds, with per-tenant isolation by compartment + IAM (see below).
- **Resources** — curated DevRel guides, demos, and the maintainer's public observability projects, mapped per service.
- **[Interactive launchpad](https://obs.octodemo.cloud/launchpad.html)** — the companion operations console.

## Start with you — personas and industries

The site opens with a **persona + industry** selector, not a product list. Pick who you are and where you work, and it points you at the right levels, services, and default lens.

| Persona | Default lens | Levels |
|---|---|---|
| Executive / service owner | Executive | L0, L1, L4 |
| Platform engineer / cloud architect | Architect | L0–L3, L5 |
| SRE / operations (NOC) | Practitioner | L1–L3 |
| DBA / database team | Practitioner | L2 |
| Security / SOC / governance | Architect | L0, L2, L4 |
| Developer / application team | Practitioner | L1, L3 |
| AI / ML engineer | Architect | L4 |
| Operator / ISV (multitenancy) | Architect | L0, L5 |

Industries (financial services, telco, healthcare, public sector, retail, ISV/SaaS) tilt the emphasis — e.g. financial services leans on L2 database depth and L0 audit; ISV/SaaS leans on L5 multitenancy.

**Access is governed by OCI IAM.** Each persona maps to an **OCI Group** with **policies scoped to compartments** — an *admin* group manages the services, a *reader* group has read-only access — in the Landing Zone Common Identity Domain.

## The L0 → L5 model

| Level | Theme | Question it answers | Example services |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0** | Govern & land | Is the platform ready to be observed safely? | Observability compartment & IAM, Tags, Vault, Audit |
| **L1** | See & alert | Is it healthy, and what just happened? | Monitoring, Logging, Notifications, Events, Health Checks, Dashboards |
| **L2** | Diagnose deep | Why did it happen, and are we out of room? | Database Management, Ops Insights, Log Analytics, Management Agent, Stack Monitoring, Java Management |
| **L3** | Correlate & automate | What's the business impact, and what can self-heal? | APM + OpenTelemetry, Connector Hub, Resource Scheduler, OS Management Hub, Fleet App Mgmt |
| **L4** | Observe & govern AI | Is the agent correct, grounded, safe, improving? | APM GenAI, Generative AI (judge) + guardrails, Logging Analytics anomaly, Data Science eval, Cloud Guard Instance Security, Gen AI Agents |
| **L5** | Operate multitenancy | How do operators run it across tenants and clouds? | Centralized Log Analytics aggregation, multicloud ingestion, per-tenant isolation by compartment + IAM |

> Stack Monitoring's capabilities are converging into OCI Monitoring — there is no need to replace it with separate services.

## L5 — Multitenancy and observability at scale

The multitenant approach is **not just access scoping**. The real model is **centralized aggregation**:

1. **Sources** — per-tenant OCI tenancies (OKE, databases, OCI services, audit logs) **and** other clouds / on-premises: AWS (incl. EKS), Microsoft Azure (incl. Oracle Database@Azure, AKS), Google Cloud (GKE), on-prem K8s/VMs/databases, and Fusion SaaS / OIC.
2. **Collect** — Service Connector Hub (OCI-native), Management Agent, **FluentD / Fluent-Bit via Helm** for Kubernetes (the [`oracle-quickstart/oci-kubernetes-monitoring`](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-kubernetes-monitoring) solution — **OKE and AWS EKS are documented**, other clusters via the generic Helm path), OCI Functions (a processing/bridge, not a native collector), Object Storage, and the REST API / direct upload.
3. **Aggregate & analyse** — a central **OCI Log Analytics**: 250+ out-of-the-box sources, clustering, link analysis, detection rules, tiered (active + archive) storage, and GenAI-assisted analytics.
4. **Operate** — an operator cross-tenant fleet view (SLOs, capacity, chargeback) plus per-tenant views.

**Cross-tenancy aggregation is not automatic** — it relies on per-source forwarding (Service Connector Hub / Streaming / Object Storage) plus IAM cross-tenancy `Define` / `Endorse` / `Admit` policies, and Log Analytics is regional. **Isolation** stays per-tenant, by **log group + compartment** and IAM — Tenancy / Platform / Environment(Project) observability teams, each an admin and a reader OCI group — grounded in the official [OCI Database Observability LZ add-on (`obs_v2`)](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/obs_v2/addons/oci-db-observability). Adding a tenant, environment, or project is repetition: clone the compartment, group, and policy.

A real design also pins down: **agent trust** (Management Agent install keys per tenancy/namespace, Vault secrets, rotation, Management Gateway/private egress), **network & security** (private endpoints / Service Gateway, Zero Trust Packet Routing, operator-access audit), **region/data residency**, and **capacity & cost** (ingest volume, retention, recall cost, delivery semantics, service limits).

**Five best practices at scale:** (1) establish a common correlation key (transaction ID, ECID), (2) centralize all log sources, (3) build correlated dashboards, (4) automate alerts and anomaly detection, (5) embed observability into the design.

## Propose a new monitoring scenario

This guide is meant to grow. To add a use case (e.g. "observability for an EBS estate" or "tracing a CrewAI multi-agent app"):

1. Read **[docs/PROPOSE-A-SCENARIO.md](docs/PROPOSE-A-SCENARIO.md)** — the scenario template and what a good one contains.
2. Open a **[Monitoring scenario issue](../../issues/new?template=monitoring-scenario.yml)** (or copy the template into a PR).
3. Or extend the data directly: add an entry to [`assets/resources.js`](assets/resources.js) (links/projects per service) or propose a new finder pattern in [`assets/guide.js`](assets/guide.js).
